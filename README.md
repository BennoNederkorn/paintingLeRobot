![AI-Powered Stencil Drawing Robot Banner](./ai-robotic-artist-banner.svg)

> A dual-arm robotic system that uses a pipeline of computer vision, large language models, and imitation learning to transform digital images into physical drawings with colored stencils.

This project was developed in 48 hours for the **Munich AI & Robotics Hackathon 2024**.

## ü§ñ Project Overview

This repository contains the software for an autonomous robotic artist. The system takes any digital image as input, intelligently deconstructs it, plans a drawing strategy, and then uses two **LeRobot** arms to execute the drawing on a piece of paper using a set of physical stencils.

The core workflow is as follows:
1.  **Image Ingestion & Analysis:** A user provides a digital image. Our computer vision pipeline uses a blend of classical OpenCV techniques and a pre-trained StyleGAN to analyze the image, segment it by color, and break it down into a series of drawable vector primitives (lines and curves).
2.  **LLM Task Planning:** These primitives are passed to **Mistral AI**. The large language model acts as the mission planner, generating a high-level, step-by-step sequential plan. This plan optimizes the drawing process, deciding the order of colors and stencils to minimize tool changes and drawing time.
3.  **Perception & Calibration:** An **Intel RealSense D405** depth camera continuously perceives the workspace. It dynamically locates the drawing canvas and the set of available colored stencils, feeding their precise coordinates to the motion planner.
4.  **Dual-Arm Execution:** The drawing plan is executed by two LeRobot arms. Using policies trained via **imitation learning**, the arms can perform delicate manipulation tasks‚Äîpicking, placing, and orienting stencils‚Äîand then trace the lines with a drawing tool, all without direct force feedback.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **End-to-End Autonomy:** Fully automated pipeline from a digital `.jpg` or `.png` to a physical, multi-color drawing.
* **LLM-Powered Strategy:** Leverages the power of Mistral AI for high-level reasoning and efficient task sequencing.
* **Advanced 3D Perception:** Utilizes the Intel RealSense D405's RGB and Depth streams for robust object localization and workspace calibration.
* **Imitation-Learned Skills:** Employs policies trained on human demonstrations via the `lerobot` framework for fluid and precise manipulation of stencils and drawing tools.
* **Dual-Arm Coordination:** Designed for a two-arm setup to divide labor, for instance, one arm places the stencil while the other draws, enabling more complex and efficient operation.
* **Visual Servoing (Stretch Goal):** The system is architected to support closed-loop visual feedback to correct for inaccuracies during the drawing process in real-time.
